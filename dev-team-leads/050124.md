### Weekly Team Summary for Review

Our team has made progress on our Warmup Exercise. For our web widget, we have decided to choose the Task List. We have a basic implementation ready and are working on implementing a few cool features to aim for the top 5 spots.
We have started drafting the SWOT analysis (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, Threat) and a brief summary of our learnings. We aim to complete everything including the video by Thursday.
