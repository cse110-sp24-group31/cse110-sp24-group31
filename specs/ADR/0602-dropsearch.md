# Search bar and database 

## Context and Problem Statement

We had originally wanted a feature where users could easily access their notes based on keywords. This would improve quality of life for users as they would not have to remember exactly when they took note of something, and could simply find the instance of where they mentioned it.


## Considered Options

The most optimal solution was a search bar which would return all days where a certain string was mentioned. We had a few ideas on how where this storage would pull its information from

- JSON file was one of them, which would utilize the Node JS module to pull information directly from the document, and would also be able to edit, delete, and create new strings or information on the document.
- Another idea was an SQL or NoSQL database, which would have extremely quick retrieve speeds and could also store mre information than the JSON file while taking up less hard drive storage, as this would be a cloud service.
- The option if we ran out of time was to scrap this feature entirely, as both solutions would require more work from the developers side to learn material outside of the course's scope and apply it within the deadline. 

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: At the beginning of week 9, after assesing the group's progress we decided that this feature would not be able to be implemented within the set deadline. This was not a key feature as it was not absolutely necessary for the functionality of our project. Furthermore it required team memebers to learn extra information, which could take longer than the time we had. Therefore we thought it best to not include this in our final project.

### Consequences

* Good, because {positive consequence, e.g., improvement of one or more desired qualities, …}
* Bad, because {negative consequence, e.g., compromising one or more desired qualities, …}


## Pros and Cons of the Options

**Pro**: This would allow our developers much more time to work on and perfect our other features and UI to create a much more polished and appealing website.
**Cons**: This gets rid of a feature that would have been a massive advantage that our product has that others on the market could lack, or allows us to compete with products that did.
