# Team Working Agreement
## Term:Spring 2024
## Creation: 04/16/2024

### **1.Group Identification**<br>
- Team number: Team 31
- Team name: Git pushers

### **2.Primary forms of communciation and relevant expectations**

Primary communication will be done using slack. Creation of new channels will be done per case when certain assignments/portions of assignemnts are assigned. It is expected that everyone checks Slack **DAILY** in order to make sure you are caught up on all relevent updates. It is expected to view Slack multiple times a day as due dates near especially the final due date. Respond to messages within 12 hours. Meetings will be primarily done through Zoom but we will have in person meetings based on availability. It is fully expected that every member legitimately attemps to attend all these meetings, those who don't will be recorded in meeting minutes.

### **3.Scheduling Meetings**

Meeting times will be discussed around the time of lecture either before or after. This information will then be later released on Slack for further confirmation for those who were unable to attend lecture. Team leads will send a notification 3 hours before any meeting time. It is fully expected all members attent all meetings unless providing a valid reason why. 

### **4.General Responsibilies**

Everyone is expected to contribute to every assignment. When assigned and delegated a specific task it is expected to be completed as soon as possible. If this is not possible communication is required to express why a certain task cannot be completed. If we assign a deadline for when we as a group want something donw we expect **EVERYONE** to complete this task by the given time. <br>
Communciation is key. If anything is going wrong whether it be personal, make sure the group knows. Everyone goes through their own lives and sometimes can't contribute as much but you need to let everyone know. The important thing is that this is communicated with the group and hopefully for future assignemnts the adressed person can contribute more. 

### **5.Conflict Resolution**

Anyone who fails to follow provided rules will face direct discussion and addressing from a team lead. There will be a discussion deciding the validity of the excuse as to why this member failed to uphold the required rules. This will be opened up to discussion by the group to see what is the best option moving forward. By default there will be only a 1 warning system in which if the majority of the member view the scenario worthy of a warning, 1 will be applied. Failure to improve will result in addressal to TA to discuss the lack of participation from said member. <br>
For example: If a member fails to do their part consisnatly for certain group assignments initially they will simply be confronted and helped through completing it to make sure the group is not penalized. However if it seems this was done due to pure negligence and lack of care they will be warned. If the behavior repeats itself they will be reported to staff.

### **6.Staff Expectations**

If a team member fails to meet the expectaions listed staff memebers will get involved. The team will still be responsible for completing the group assignments accordingly, filling in for the missing person's work. However once presented, staff will come in and discuss the issue in attempts to resolve any disputes.
