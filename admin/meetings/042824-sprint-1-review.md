## Feedback and discussion to determine what changes the team needs to make 

Gather feedback from members about how they felt working together on the warmup exercise. Based on this we decided on the following:

1. We decided to make different channels on Slack for different members of the team to improve communication. We might also look into other forms of communication in later weeks if required.
2. We decided to make most team meetings mandatory for everyone to improve team participation and ensure everyone is contributing to the project.
3. We also decided to group up team members in groups of 2 or 3 to work on different aspects of the project to balance the workload and improve efficiency.
