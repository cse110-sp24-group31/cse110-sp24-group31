## Agenda:
Discuss all prompts relevent to Brainstorming. Set up Miro to allow for better and easier clean brainstorming formats for all people to easily collaborte and work on at the same time.

## Summary:
Miro accounts were made for easy collaboration and we used the sticky notes features with overarching broader categories in order to discuss the basics of what we want in the project / the purpose of the project. We decided on a space theme as we 
thought that could be extremely visually appealing while also creating an interesting atmosphere for users.
