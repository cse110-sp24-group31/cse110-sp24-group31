## Agenda:
Discuss all prompts relevent to Brainstorming. Set up Miro to allow for better and easier clean brainstorming formats for all people to easily collaborte and work on at the same time.

## Summary:
We succesfully had a majority meeting creating and outlining what was expected from the project, and different things that we would want in our project (using Miro). This included researching relevent issues and features that are common to developer journals and seeing which we could implement and how we can make it balanced towards user experience.

## Specific Notes:
- Miro accounts were made for easy collaboration and we used the sticky notes features with overarching broader categories in order to discuss the basics of what we want in the project / the purpose of the project.
- Discussed the basics of what we think is needed a development journal after researching relevent information. Defining what we believe the problem/task to be at hand, and how we can work towards achieving what we want. This was dicsussed with the user experience in mind.
- Decided on a space theme as we thought that could be extremely visually appealing while also creating an interesting atmosphere for users.
- Set up fundamental ideas that we thought could be good to implement at a very high level.
