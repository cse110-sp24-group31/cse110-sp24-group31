## Agenda:
Discuss all prompts relevent to Brainstorming. Set up Miro to allow for better and easier clean brainstorming formats for all people to easily collaborte and work on at the same time.

## Summary:
We succesfully had a majority meeting creating and outlining what was expected from the project, and different things that we would want in our project (using Miro). This included researching relevent issues and features that are common to developer journals and seeing which we could implement and how we can make it balanced towards user experience. We also decided on how we were going to segment groups to allow us to better succeed.

## Discussion Notes:
- Miro accounts were made for easy collaboration and we used the sticky notes features with overarching broader categories in order to discuss the basics of what we want in the project / the purpose of the project.
- Discussed the basics of what we think is needed a development journal after researching relevent information. Defining what we believe the problem/task to be at hand, and how we can work towards achieving what we want. This was dicsussed with the user experience in mind.
- Decided on a space theme as we thought that could be extremely visually appealing while also creating an interesting atmosphere for users.
- Set up fundamental ideas that we thought could be good to implement at a very high level.
- Created pairings based on preferences (these are not hard locked and can always be subject to change).
  

## Action Items:
- Primarily Nikhil and Ishan working on the slide decks in order to present to the TA. Full access was made to everyone so if you can contribute, please do.
- Everyone: get to know who you are working with and set up a basic shcedule that you plan on working with.
- If time permits, search up which features are likely doable with our specifications to know which features we want to focus on.

## Next Steps:
Try to get comfortable and get to know the person you are working with. Set up schedules that allow better collaboration. Work on the formal pitch slides/pdf in order to present to the TA for confirmation on the project. Set up everything on Github that is needed to help us get started procedurally.
