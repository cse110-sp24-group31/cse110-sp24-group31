Reviewed E2E testing and finished all code. We still need the main page to be updated with all the current code. But every function is working properly. We have also begun E2E /unit tests and have added them to the pipeline. Our pipeline has s few extra tests that are returning as not passing as we have not implemented the functionality, but all other tests are passing.
