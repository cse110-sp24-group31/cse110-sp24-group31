# Dev meet

Atendees: Nikhil, Ishan, Kevin, Charlotte, Zhami, Brian, Gavin, Liam

We all met to talk about the previous week's work and any issues people were having with the team. We were able to sort out 2 major issues, with the team work distribution and leadership issues. After sorting these out we reviewed the previous week's work, which was the warmup project. We realized our weak points were related to the issues we were having, and fixed them for the final project. Also as the pitch had been approved, we were able to talk it through and discuss more for the future of the project

# Retrospective

Atendees: Nikhil, Ishan, Kevin, Charlotte, Zhami, Zilin, Gavin, Liam

We met to debrief the developers on the planning phase and assign out some of the primary tasks to groups of developers, which were also created and approved by the group members in this meeting. We also set the deadlines for the next part of the project, and are trying to keep a pace to finish our project (development, testing, and deployment) by the end of week 9.
