Attendees: Nikhil, Kevin, Charlotte, Zhami, Zilin, Liam, Newton, Brian, Gavin

## Person tab

Base implementation complete. HTML and CSS fully functional. This feature is used to save people with assosiated information. Each person can be added with a click and will require some information to fill out about them, including name, gender, and assosiated links/information. These can be edited later as well. An avatar is assosiated with each person as well. This feature has also began adaptation of theme into work. To dos include adding email/phone number to each person, changing an infinitly expanding doc to pages, and a consus for how we plan to use the avatars.

## Calendar

Base implementation complete. This feature is used to keep track of dates, deadlines, and a general pacing guide for larger projects. Also can be used to take notes/journal for each day. To dos are interactive buttons to the calendar, as well as a script to add notes into when a specific day in clicked.

## Project task

This is the main view of current projects and assosiated notes, drawings, code snippets, and people involved. Not yet fully implented, but the general functions exist. To dos are to clean up the implementation and finish/fix the HTML and CSS for the main page and have each project task be able to be clicked into for further detail on each project.

## Progress bar

This is a convinience feature which displays the days until a specific project is due. We are also implementing a seperate bar to show how much of a project has been completed based on key checkpoints for the project, which is an input from the project task creation page. This is temporarily on hold until we finish the project tasks.

## Current week's plan

We want to finish the person tab, calenday, and project task's HTML and CSS portion. As soon as we have the complete base of exactly how we want these features to look, we will move towards finishing the javascript for each of the features. We also plan to incorporate a search for keywords throughout the journal as well as a database to store the information, and will be doing more research on how to incorporate this feature.
