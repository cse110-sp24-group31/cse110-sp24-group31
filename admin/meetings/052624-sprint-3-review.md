## Projects tasks
Each project is able to be added properly. Images, notes, and calendar are all able to be added properly. Color display for how long the project is works fine. Saves information past refreshes. TO DOs: add checkpoints to incorporate progress bars.

## People tab
Added phone + verifier + background. Added additional information bar. UI is fully updated as a space theme and all dropdown menus work as expected. TO DO: have the progression stay after refresh.

## Progress bar
Draggable and space themed. Also reset and autocomplete. Need to implement a mathematical function to automatically assign a progress meter that refreshes daily. 

## Calendar
Worked on calendar and add notes function. Interactivity working and dropdown menu working properly. Does not save information yet so we have to implement it. This feature exists properly in Project tasks so should be an extremely quick addition. Also may need UI upgrades. Maybe needs highlighting dates for due dates.

## Work for next week
All features completed individually. We also want to start creating test cases and add more to our pipeline for linting and styling. Will also begin e2e and unit tests for functionality of features. We are aiming to have all code pushed to main and not clashing with each other. Also we would like to merge all features onto main homepage rather than each on their own site, which will happen at the end of this week or next depending on how much progress gets done.
