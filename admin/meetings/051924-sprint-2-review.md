## Feedback and discussion to determine what changes the team needs to make 

Gather feedback from members about how they felt working together so far. Based on this we decided on the following:

1. We decided to push make pull requests for code/features that are ready to be pushed to main branch. However, we would only push all the code to main branch towards the end of the project.
2. We decided to add Brian to the project cards team as more help was needed in that feature due to its complex and time consuming nature.
3. We also decided to conduct more extensive unit testing of all code being implemented to ensure minimum errors.
